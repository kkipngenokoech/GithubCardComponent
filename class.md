# class component

to create class components in React you:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
    // you should have a constructor since  it is a class
    // make a lot of use for the this keyword

    render (){
        return (
            // you can have a lot of functions for the class component but you must have the render() function
        )
    }
}
```
